# The association between SYCP3 c.657T>C polymorphism and recurrent pregnancy loss

The point of meta-analysis on polymorphism is converting ternary data of genotype (TT/TC/CC) into binary data of exposed group/non-exposed group according to different genetic models.

Exposed group refers to those who are affected by the mutant gene and exhibit traits, in this case, specifically due to the effect of mutant C in the SYCP3.

In recent studies, there are 5 different genetic models: dominant model, recessive model, heterozygote model, homozygote model and allele model. Here, I will present a fourfold table of five genetic models. 

### Dominant model

In the dominant model, both CC and CT showed mutant traits, and TT was the wild trait, which represents CC+CT was the exposed group and TT was the non-exposed group. Therefore, the fourfold table was transformed as follows:

|                 |    **Case**     |      **Control**      |
| :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------------: |
|   **Exposed**   | case.CC+case.CT | control.CC+control.CT |
| **Non-exposed** |     case.TT     |      control.TT       |

### Recessive model

In the recessive model, only homozygote mutant CC can show mutant traits and can be called exposed group.



|                 |      Case       |        Control        |
| :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------------: |
|   **Exposed**   |     case.CC     |      control.CC       |
| **Non-exposed** | case.TT+case.CT | control.TT+control.CT |

### Heterozygote model / Co-dominant model

|                 | **Case** | **Control** |
| :-------------: | :------: | :---------: |
|   **Exposed**   | case.CT  | control.CT  |
| **Non-exposed** | case.TT  | control.TT  |

### Homozygote model

|                 |  Case   |  Control   |
| :-------------: | :-----: | :--------: |
|   **Exposed**   | case.CC | control.CC |
| **Non-exposed** | case.TT | control.TT |

### Allel model

|                 |  Case  |  Control  |
| :-------------: | :----: | :-------: |
|   **Exposed**   | case.C | control.C |
| **Non-exposed** | case.T | control.T |
